Analysis of migrations to Florida from 2014-2018. 

This file aims to understand migration flows to and from Florida. The analysis includes understanding the top sources of positive migration flows to Florida, as well as identifying the few places that Florida actually had net-negative migration flows to. 
Additionally, this analysis looks at the places where Florida's positive migration flows were headed to, such as Metropolitan Statistical Areas, as defined by the US Census Bureau, and other destinations known for vacationers and retirees. 

Data for this analysis was sourced from the US Census Bureau, is linked to in the Jupyter Notebook, and will also be made available in the Github repository. 

This analysis uses Pandas, Matplotlib.pyplot, and Seaborn.
